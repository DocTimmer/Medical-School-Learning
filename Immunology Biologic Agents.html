    {
        question: "1. Biologic agents are primarily derived from which of the following sources?",
        options: ["Chemical synthesis in a laboratory", "Living culture systems or blood", "Plant extracts and botanicals", "Inorganic mineral compounds"],
        correctAnswer: "Living culture systems or blood",
        rationale: "• Why: Biologics are complex molecules produced by or derived from living organisms, such as bacteria, yeast, or mammalian cells.\n• This is in contrast to conventional, small-molecule drugs, which are chemically synthesized."
    },
    {
        question: "2. A monoclonal antibody with a name ending in '-omab' is most likely derived from what source?",
        options: ["Human", "Humanized", "Chimeric", "Murine"],
        correctAnswer: "Murine",
        rationale: "• Why: The suffix '-omab' indicates the antibody is derived entirely from a mouse (murine) source.\n• This is the earliest and most immunogenic type of monoclonal antibody."
    },
    {
        question: "3. Which of the following biologic agents works by directly targeting and inhibiting TNF-α?",
        options: ["Abatacept", "Anakinra", "Infliximab", "Omalizumab"],
        correctAnswer: "Infliximab",
        rationale: "• Why: Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to TNF-α, preventing it from binding to its receptors.\n• Abatacept blocks T-cell co-stimulation, Anakinra is an IL-1 receptor antagonist, and Omalizumab targets IgE."
    },
    {
        question: "4. A major disadvantage of monoclonal antibody therapy is the inability to be administered by which route?",
        options: ["Intravenous", "Subcutaneous", "Intramuscular", "Oral"],
        correctAnswer: "Oral",
        rationale: "• Why: Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that would be denatured and inactivated by the acid and enzymes in the GI tract.\n• Therefore, they must be administered via injection or infusion."
    },
    {
        question: "5. Which type of monoclonal antibody is considered the least immunogenic?",
        options: ["Murine mAbs", "Chimeric mAbs", "Humanized mAbs", "Human mAbs"],
        correctAnswer: "Human mAbs",
        rationale: "• Why: Because they are composed of 100% human protein sequences, these antibodies (ending in -umab) are the least likely to be recognized as foreign by the immune system.\n• Immunogenicity decreases as the percentage of human protein increases."
    },
    {
        question: "6. What is the primary mechanism of action for Abatacept?",
        options: ["Inhibiting the IL-1 receptor", "Binding to TNF-α to prevent receptor activation", "Blocking T-cell activation by binding to B7 on APCs", "Depleting B-cells from circulation"],
        correctAnswer: "Blocking T-cell activation by binding to B7 on APCs",
        rationale: "• Why: Abatacept prevents the co-stimulatory 'second signal' required for T-cell activation by blocking the CD28-B7 interaction."
    },
    {
        question: "7. Before initiating therapy with a TNF-α inhibitor like infliximab, screening for which latent infection is crucial?",
        options: ["Cytomegalovirus (CMV)", "Tuberculosis (TB)", "Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV)", "Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)"],
        correctAnswer: "Tuberculosis (TB)",

    },
    {
        question: "8. A biologic drug with the name Ustekinumab most likely targets what?",
        options: ["A tumor", "A virus", "An interleukin", "Bone"],
        correctAnswer: "An interleukin",

        options: ["The Fab region of an IgM antibody", "The Fc region of an IgG antibody", "A viral protein for cell entry", "A bacterial toxin to induce apoptosis"],
        correctAnswer: "The Fc region of an IgG antibody",
        rationale: "• Why: The Fc region of IgG is fused to the receptor domain to prolong the molecule's half-life in the bloodstream by engaging with the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)."
    },
    {
        question: "10. Which of the following side effects is specifically associated with anti-TNF biologics, often prompting baseline ANA level assessment?",
        options: ["Hypersensitivity reactions", "Drug-induced lupus-like syndrome", "Reactivation of hepatitis B", "Bone marrow suppression"],
        correctAnswer: "Drug-induced lupus-like syndrome",
        rationale: "• Why: Anti-TNF agents are known to have a risk of inducing autoantibodies and a lupus-like syndrome, making a baseline ANA important to assess for pre-existing autoimmunity."
    },
    {
        question: "11. Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody. What suffix would you expect its name to end with?",
        options: ["-omab", "-ximab", "-zumab", "-umab"],
        correctAnswer: "-zumab",
        rationale: "• Why: The suffix '-zumab' is the specific naming convention for humanized monoclonal antibodies, which are approximately 95% human."
    },
    {
        question: "12. What is the mechanism of action of Omalizumab?",
        options: ["It binds to IgE, preventing it from binding to mast cells.", "It competitively inhibits the IL-1 receptor.", "It targets TNF-α to reduce inflammation.", "It blocks B7 on antigen-presenting cells."],

        options: ["Low cost of manufacturing", "Ability to be administered orally", "Lack of any side effects", "High specificity for a single target"],
        correctAnswer: "High specificity for a single target",
        rationale: "• Why: Biologics are designed to hit a specific molecular target, minimizing the broad, off-target effects seen with drugs like corticosteroids."
    },
    {
        question: "14. Anakinra is unique among IL-1 inhibitors because it can:",
        options: ["Be administered orally", "Cross the blood-brain barrier", "Target both IL-1 and TNF-α", "Be used without any risk of infection"],
        correctAnswer: "Cross the blood-brain barrier",
        rationale: "• Why: This property makes Anakinra useful for treating diseases with inflammation of the central nervous system."
    },
    {
        question: "15. Which of the following tests is an appropriate way to screen for latent TB?",
        options: ["A chest X-ray", "A sputum smear for acid-fast bacilli", "An interferon-γ release assay (IGRA)", "A complete blood count (CBC)"],
        correctAnswer: "An interferon-γ release assay (IGRA)",

        question: "17. How does Etanercept differ from Infliximab?",
        options: ["Etanercept targets IL-1 while Infliximab targets TNF-α.", "Etanercept is a monoclonal antibody, while Infliximab is a fusion protein.", "Etanercept is a fusion protein, while Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody.", "Etanercept can be taken orally, while Infliximab cannot."],
        correctAnswer: "Etanercept is a fusion protein, while Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody.",
        rationale: "• Why: Although both target TNF-α, they belong to different structural classes of biologic agents. Etanercept is a 'decoy receptor' fusion protein, while Infliximab is a chimeric mAb."
    },
    {
        question: "18. The composition of a humanized monoclonal antibody is approximately:",
        options: ["100% human protein", "95% human protein", "65% human protein", "0% human protein"],
        correctAnswer: "95% human protein",
        rationale: "• Why: Humanized antibodies (-zumab) are mostly human, with only the small hypervariable regions derived from a murine source."
    },
    {
        question: "19. Which of the following is NOT a common pre-screening or mitigation strategy before starting biologic therapy?",
        options: ["Vaccination for pneumococcal disease", "A baseline complete blood count and liver function tests", "Starting a course of prophylactic antibiotics", "Screening for Hepatitis B and C"],
        correctAnswer: "Starting a course of prophylactic antibiotics",
